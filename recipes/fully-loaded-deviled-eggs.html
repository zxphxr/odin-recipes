    <h1>Fully Loaded Deviled Eggs</h1>

    <h2>Description</h2>

        <p>My children and husband go nuts over these deviled eggs with sour cream. I made them for a potluck at work and have been asked for them ever since. (If you can keep people away from them, you're doing better than I ever could.) The time I spend prepping this depends on how fast you shell your eggs. I have two girls, so we knock this out in about 30 minutes (minus cooking time).</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>

        <ul>
            <li>12 eggs</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon vegetable oil</li>
            <li>1 small onion, chopped</li>
            <li>1/4 cup sour cream</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons mayonnaise</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon ranch dressing, or to taste</li>
            <li>1 1/2 teaspoons Dijon mustard</li>
            <li> 1/2 teaspoons garlic powder</li>
            <li>1/2 pinch onion powder</li>
            <li>1/8 teaspoon lemon pepper seasoning</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon bacon bits</li>
            <li>1 cup finely shredded sharp Cheddar cheese</li>
            <li>1/4 teaspoon paprika</li>
        </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>

        <ol>
            <li>Place eggs into a large pot and cover with lightly salted water. Bring to a boil and reduce heat to medium; boil eggs for 10 to 12 minutes.</li>
            <li>Drain boiling water and fill the pot with cold water. Let eggs sit in cold water for 2 minutes, then pour off water and replace with more cold water. Repeat until eggs are thoroughly chilled, 10 to 15 minutes. Peel eggs; set aside.</li>
            <li>Heat vegetable oil in a small skillet over medium heat; cook and stir onion until translucent, about 5 minutes. Remove from heat and let cool.</li>
            <li>Slice eggs in half lengthwise and scoop yolks into a bowl; transfer egg white halves to a plate.</li>
            <li>Mash egg yolks with a fork; stir in sour cream, mayonnaise, ranch dressing, Dijon mustard, garlic powder, onion powder, and lemon pepper seasoning until yolk mixture is smooth. Stir in saut√©ed onions, bacon bits, and Cheddar cheese.</li>
            <li>Generously fill egg halves with filling and sprinkle each deviled egg with paprika. Refrigerate until chilled before serving.</li>
        </ol>
